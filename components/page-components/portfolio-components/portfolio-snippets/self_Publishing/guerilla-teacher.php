		<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Guerrilla Teacher, vol 1 is actually my Master's thesis from the University 
    		of Calgary.  I was going through a lot of change at the time, as I had just moved out here, and it was a way 
			to keep calm during a rough situation.  It's also an interesting look at how to present massive amounts of text 
			in website form, a feat that isn't normally seen, and seldom done effectively.  I'm proud of how it turned out.

        <p class="portfolio-paragraph">The website is written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with significant 
			amounts of custom coding coding to create its unique navigational experience.  The website could easily be 
			converted into a book, brochure, manual, or any other medium designed to hold significant amounts text or 
			photos.  It can also be attached to a database for a smoother experience, with much faster loading speeds.
