		<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Guild Saga is an NFT-based, crypto-mining game, by independant game developer:
			Occelot Technologies.  They needed a website that would coincide with the launch of several new updates and 
			features to their core game, as well as an expansion game.  It is the only time in my career so far that 
			I've worked with a dedicated designer, and I'm proud of the results!
		</p>

        <p class="portfolio-paragraph">This web application was a legacy project that I took over from a developer about 
			to go on a paternity leave.  As such, it's not written in one specific style, but actually two styles that 
			are blended together.  I wrote most of the JavaScript in the site, but other programming languages feature 
			prominently, and I had little to do with the coding in those languages.
