		<p class="portfolio-paragraph">My first ever gallery piece was this resumé website, and I'm still proud of it!  
			Resumé websites are becoming more popular, as later generations seek a more adventurous lifestyle than their 
			older generational counterparts.  That's all well and good, but the consequence of all of this adventure is 
			that most resumés are now very difficult to reduce to two pages.  Resumé websites get around this restriction, 
			allowing you to craft a more simple, two page resumé for individual jobs, that then transports the reader to 
			the larger resumé through links.
		</p>

		<p class="portfolio-paragraph">This website is designed and built using very simple web developmet techniques.  
			It's just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and there are no large or custom features that significantly 
			reduce it's loading speed.  It's so simple, in fact, that it pairs well with some of my courses on website 
			and product management, allowing you to learn some key components of web development and design, while you 
			learn to assert yourself professionally, too.
