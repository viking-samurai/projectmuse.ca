		<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Love and Chaos is a website I built for a Shaman who wanted to expand His business 
			and media pressence.  It is a blog-style website, designed to be paired with a more dominant media structure, 
			such as a dedicated podcast, or a YoutTube or Tik Tok channel, with the two being more interchangable than with 
			other website designs.  Its attractive design hides an extremely functional navigation system that draws the 
			reader into each new section of this blog-style website.
		</p>
		<p class="portfolio-paragraph">  
			This website is built largely in PHP and JavaScript, and it could very easily support more forms, or even 
			a database.  Otherwise, the website adheres to the 'big, bold, and beautiful' standard of marketing, 
			with large and bountiful pages in behind the landing page, for a wholesome and dedicated blogging experience.  
			This website is built largely in PHP and JavaScript.
