		<h3>About the technology</h3>
	</header>
	<p class="">The MERN stack, composed in a PHP framework, is a modern programming stack with a twist.  
		While the MERN stack is an adaptable, scalable technology stack that works well for all websites 
		and web applications, it works particularly well for websites and applications where the owner 
		expects substantial daily user traffic on the front-end.
	</p>
	<p class="">  PHP, on the other hand, is a classic, back-end language, noted for both its speed and 
		security, as well as its greater synergy with modern SEO and data management practices, through 
		a concept called server-side scripting.  This method of displaying a website right from the server 
		allows search engines to view more of the website, allowing for better cataloguing, and a greater 
		understanding of your website's purpose to potential customers, as searches are being made.
