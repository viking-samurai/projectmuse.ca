	</header>
	<p class="">Ryan has been coding and programming since 2015.  He enjoys working in vanilla JavaScript, 
		as well as its most popular stack, the MERN stack.  He has been a writer since high school, and enjoys 
		blending writing styles from across his travels and careers into his websites and applications.  Ryan 
		continues to expand and improve as a full-stack developer, having started offering websites and 
		applications written in a blend of PHP with the MERN stack.  PHP is a popular back-end language that 
		greatly improves website loading times as well as back-end functionality.

		<h3>About my tech stack</h3>
	</header>
	<p class="">The MERN stack, written in a PHP framework, is a modern technology stack with a twist.  The MERN 
		stack is an adaptable tech stack that works well for all web applications, but especially well for applications 
		where the owner expects substantial user traffic.  PHP, on the other hand, is a classic back-end language, 
		noted for its security, speed, and greater synergy with modern SEO and data manipulation.  Websites built 
		in this style enjoy both speed and scalability, growing effortlessly with your business.
