	<p class="main-offers-paragraph">
		Data drives the business world, and everyone uses search engines, so it's important to know 
		how your business numbers are stacking up.  Furthermore, it takes years of trial and error 
		before a solid plan for cracking the first page of Google search results is even possible, 
		and even then, constant tweaks might still be necessary to maintain that position, once 
		it's been attained.  Lastly, competition for specific keywords can be quite fierce, in 
		addition to the challenge of keeping up with known algorithms.  And that's just for Google.  
		There are at least three other main search engines that people use in the form	of Bing, 
		Yahoo, and Mac's own preferred browser: Safari.
	</p>
	<p class="main-offers-paragraph">
		And that's just what it takes to manage your search engine optimization.  Many modern businesses 
		optimize their processes based on the data they're able to collect and incorporate into their 
		practices.  Data extraction is a profession all on it's own, and is generally considered separate 
		to the actual web building process.  It's hard work, but at Project Muse, I can handle that.  
		Check out my premium packages below to see if either a Search Engine Optimization, or else a 
		data management package would be right for your business needs.

			Search Engine Optimization, or SEO for short, is the art and science of getting your website 
			to appear as high in the search order of as many different search engines as possible.  Done 
			properly, it is a years-long process of planning keywords and then verifying how, how often, 
			for how long, and from where your customers are accessing your website or web application, 
			using the keywords that you're keeping track of.  It is an intense process, unique to each 
			business or professional practice.  It is also a necessary process for companies that are keen 
			to expand.  Over time, businesses and professionals that develop and follow a plan to maintain 
			a certain position in search engine ordering get more page lands, experience more user clicks, 
			keep searchers on their websites and web applications longer, and convert more website users 
			into customers than their counterparts.  When your company is ready to start pushing serious 
			traffic and sales, Search Engine Optimization is where you start.
