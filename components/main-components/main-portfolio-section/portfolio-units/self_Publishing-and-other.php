	<p class="portfolio-paragraph">The Internet offers a simple solution for writers, photographers, academics, 
		journalists, and other professionals who write and share media, bypassing the traditional hurdle of having 
		to find a publisher or producer. You can self-publish! Imagine, your garage band's entire itinerary online, 
		or some of life's momentous occasions, all tacfully displayed and right at your fingertips – weddings, 
		presentations, prom night, those big games, even those accidental triumphs, caught on film – so family 
		and friends can relive and share these stories as often as they like, with whomever they choose.
	</p>
	<p class="portfolio-paragraph">It's called family blogging, and it's on the rise. Why deal with complex social 
		media algorithms to find your own resources if you're not aiming to go professional with social media? 
		Instead, at your next gathering or casual hangout, easily access your family blog to share and relive great 
		moments, without the stress of searching through endless feeds. It's a user-friendly way to connect with loved 
		ones and enjoy shared memories together.
