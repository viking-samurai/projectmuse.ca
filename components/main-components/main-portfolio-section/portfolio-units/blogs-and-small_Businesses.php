	<p class="portfolio-paragraph">For Calgary entrepreneurs and local businesses aiming for a strong online presence, 
        choosing the right foundation for your website or application is key. While various platforms exist, such 
	    as Drupal or Wordpress, modern full-stack solutions, like blending PHP and the MERN stack, are increasingly 
	    recognized for their superior performance, scalability, and efficiency.  This blend often leads to more 
	    environmentally conscious websites as well, which works to everyone's advantage.  So, whether you're building 
	    a community blog, or a local e-commerce platform, with robust features like user accounts and scheduled 
	    deliveries, the underlying technology you choose for your website or application significantly impacts your 
	    project's long-term success.
