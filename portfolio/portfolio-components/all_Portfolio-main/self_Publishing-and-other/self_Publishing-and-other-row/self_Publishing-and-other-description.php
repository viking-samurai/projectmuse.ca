											<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Guild Saga is an NFT-based, crypto-mining game, by independant game developer:
												Occelot Technologies.  They needed a website that would coincide with the launch of several new updates and 
												features to their core game, as well as an expansion game.  It is the only time in my career so far that 
												I've worked with a dedicated designer, and I'm proud of the results!
											</p>
											
											<p class="portfolio-paragraph">This web application was a legacy project that I took over from a developer about 
												to go on a paternity leave.  As such, it's not written in one specific style, but actually two styles that 
												are blended together.  I wrote most of the JavaScript in the site, but other programming languages feature 
												prominently, and I had little to do with the coding in those languages.

											<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Guerrilla Teacher, vol 1 is actually my Master's thesis from the University 
												of Calgary.  I was going through a lot of change at the time, as I had just moved out here, and it was a way 
												to keep calm during a rough situation.  It's also an interesting look at how to present massive amounts of text 
												in website form, a feat that isn't normally seen, and seldom done effectively.  I'm proud of how it turned out.
											</p>
											
											<p class="portfolio-paragraph">The website is written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with significant 
												amounts of custom coding coding to create its unique navigational experience.  The website could easily be 
												converted into a book, brochure, manual, or any other medium designed to hold significant amounts text or 
												photos.  It can also be attached to a database for a smoother experience, with much faster loading speeds.
