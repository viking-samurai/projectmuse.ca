											<p class="portfolio-paragraph">E-mmersion is a business that teaches languages and coding to school-aged 
												students.  The focus of the courses is on coding and programming, as well as writing for websites 
												and businesses.  They needed a website that was capable of showcasing their four main courses, 
												as well as make it easy for parents to schedule and manage their children's enrollment and classes.

												needs.  It's sleek and simple design makes it very fast and easy to navigate, while its strict focus

											<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Love and Chaos is a website I built for a Shaman who wanted to expand His business 
												and media pressence.  It is a blog-style website, designed to be paired with a more dominant media structure, 
												such as a dedicated podcast, or a YoutTube or Tik Tok channel, with the two being more interchangable than with 
												other website designs.  Its attractive design hides an extremely functional navigation system that draws the 
												reader into each new section of this blog-style website.
											</p>
											<p class="portfolio-paragraph">  
												This website is built largely in PHP and JavaScript, and it could very easily support more forms, or even 
												a database.  Otherwise, the website adheres to the 'big, bold, and beautiful' standard of marketing, 
												with large and bountiful pages in behind the landing page, for a wholesome and dedicated blogging experience.  
												This website is built largely in PHP and JavaScript.
