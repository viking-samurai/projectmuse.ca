											<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Elite Construction is a heavy construction business, based out of Ottawa, Canada.  
												They specialize in building new homes, renovating existing homes, and in the exterior enveloping of homes 
												and businesses.  The owner needed a website that would showcase the entirety of his business to prospects, 
												including a section dedicated to the new empoyees he was planning to hire.
											</p>
											
											<p class="portfolio-paragraph">This website is built primarily in the MERN stack, but using vanilla JavaScript 
												instead of React.  The reason for this is that React is designed to prevent a team of developers from tripping 
												over themselves, and is actually not more efficient for a single person to code in.  I'm especially proud 
												of the banner.  After a long project like this one, it can be rewarding to finish on a nice piece of art 
												like the banner turned out.
