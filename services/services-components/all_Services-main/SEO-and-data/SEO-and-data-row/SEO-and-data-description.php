								<p class="main-offers-paragraph">
									Data drives the business world, and everyone uses search engines, so it's extremely 
									important to know how your business numbers are stacking up.  Furthermore, it turns 
									out that making the	first page of results in a Google search, let alone coming 
									in at number one, is an extremely challenging process.  It takes years of practice, 
									a solid plan, and constant tweaks to get your page where you want it to be.  Furthermore, 
									competition for specific keywords can be quite fierce, in addition to the challenge 
									of keeping up with known algorithms.  And that's just for Google.  There are at least 
									three other main search engines that people use in the form	of Bing, Yahoo, and Mac's 
									own preferred browser: Safari.
								</p>
								<p class="main-offers-paragraph">
									And that's just what it takes to manage your search engine optimization.  Many modern 
									businesses optimize their processes based on the data they're able to collect and 
									incorporate into their practices.  Data extraction is a profession all on it's own, 
									and is generally considered separate to the actual web building process.  It's hard
									work, but at ProjectMuse.ca, we handle that.  Check out our premium packages below 
									to see if a Search Engine Optimization plan, or if a data management package would 
									be right for your business needs.

										Search Engine Optimization, or SEO for short, is the art and science of getting 
										your website to appear as high in the search order of as many different search 
										engines as possible.  Done properly, it is a years-long (lifetime) process of 
										planning keywords and then verifying how, how often, how long, and from where 
										customers are accessing your site using the keywords you're keeping track of.  
										It is an intense and costly process, unique to each individual company or proprieter.  
										But it does work, and it is a necessary process for companies that are keen to expand.  
										Over time, businesses that develop and follow a plan to maintain a certain position 
										in search engine Ordering get more page lands, experience more clicks, keep searchers 
										on their sites longer, and convert more searchers into customers then their counterparts.  
										When your company is ready to start	pushing serious sales, Search Engine Optimization 
										is where you start.

									<p class="main-offers-paragraph">
										At ProjectMuse.ca, we develop custom portfolios, unique to every business looking 
										for this type of expertise.  Our portfolios are prepared quarterly, with opportunities 
										to review your SEO successes with professionals who specialize in this field.  Think 
										of it like financial planning, but with the data collected centering on the content 
										of your website rather than your portfolio assets.  If you want to go big with your 
										business, you need to manage your SEO, and we can help with that.
