								<p class="main-offers-paragraph">
									Digital and Internet technologies are still some of the fastest growing fields 
									on the market, and with	the rise of artificial intelligece and the need for machine 
									learning specialists, there is no apparent end in sight.  At ProjectMuse.ca, I take 
									teaching code very seriously, and I have a number of course offerings based	around 
									the powerful scripting language, JavaScript, to suit yours and your family's needs.

								<p class="main-offers-paragraph">
									Digital literacy and coding are often talked about as essential skills for youth 
									growing up in today's markets, but having worked as a professional school teacher 
									around Calgary for several years, I can assure you that there is simply nowhere 
									near enough expertise in either the public boards or any private schools to adequately 
									meet the demand for these in-demand skills.  In my entire time working with either 
									the school board or the private school I was employed by, I only met a small handful 
									of teachers who were capable of programmming anything at all, let alone at a professional 
									level.  For this reason, I specialize in courses specifically geared towards school-aged 
									children who want to start learning this skill before university, so as to maximize their 
									opportunities when they arrive at that segment of their lives.  I also offer a range 
									of courses for adult learners looking expand their resum√©s by adding a programming 
									language.  JavaScript is the both the fastest growing, as well as the most in-demand 
									programming language in the world, and opens access to some of the highest paying 
									careers in the Canadian job market.

										<h3>For youth: <span style="color: #12a8f2;">Coding like Cursive</span></h3>
									</header>
									<p class="main-offers-paragraph">
										Coding like Cursive is a set of courses designed to immerse youth and young adults 
										in the concept of coding and Internet technologies sooner and more reliably than what 
										would be offered in their schooling.  I use web-building as the basis for these courses, 
										and walk students and their families through the basics of digital programming, starting 
										with HTML and CSS, and then all the way up to vanilla JavaScript.  These courses are 
										designed to supplement a student's normal schooling activites as after-school options, 
										and they can be run either online, or in-person, depending on student preference.  
										They are intended for students who are excelling in both languages and mathematics, 
										as a way to enhance those abilities through a practical outlet.
									</p>
									<p class="main-offers-paragraph">
										Furthermore, these courses can either be taken by individual students, a student 
										and their family, or as collaborative learning opportunities with up to four students 
										at a time.  While private tutoring is an excellent opportunity for eager students 
										to learn something new, there is a large and growing body of research demonstrating 
										the benefits of collaborative learning on both the subject matter itself, as well 
										as the social aspects of working in collaboration with one's peers.

										<h3>For adults: <span style="color: #12a8f2;">Program like a Pro</span></h3>
									</header>
									<p class="main-offers-paragraph">
										Program like a Pro is a set of courses similar in design to the Coding like Cursive 
										bundle listed above, but geared towards a more experienced audience.  The courses still 
										focus on JavaScript programming, but are more complex.  These courses assume a much 
										higher degree of literacy amongst class participents, and focus on training programming 
										skills for a more business oriented crowd then Coding like Cursive, which is designed 
										as a supplement to the educational material that a student would normally learn in grade 
										school.  Furthermore, the courses are offset in the sense that Program like a Pro
										starts at a higher level, and assumes that a student will already have basic skills 
										in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, placing the focus more directly on advanced JavaScript 
										programming from the start, and then moving onto more complex material from there.
									</p>
									<p class="main-offers-paragraph">
										JavaScript programming is a highly in-demand skill that will boost career prospects.  
										It is also generally regarded as one of the primary gateways to solopreneurship, 
										and the benefits of running your own business that come along that path.  Furthermore, 
										programming itself is a unique way to think, and there is growing evidence that, 
										like all forms of literacy, it engages the prefrontal cortex in ways that benefit 
										and sustain long-term mental health, and can even delay or stave off dementia 
										in a person's latter years altogether.  Beyond that, JavaScript programming, as well 
										as its associated languages, is a rich and complex form of literacy that is sure to 
										excite, infuriate, bewilder, and ultimately satisfy a curious mind, at any age.
