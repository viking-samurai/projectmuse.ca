														<h3 class="portfolio-header">Blogs and Small Business Sites</h3>
													</header>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Blogs and small business websites and applications are a genre of website geared 
														towards entrepreneurs and local businesses.  They require a beautiful front-end to attract and retain visitors, 
														and often require a back-end, either for user profiles, scheduling appointments, or building chatrooms and forums, 
														to list a few.  Most e-commerce websites fit into this category as well, and often require a more robust back-end, 
														owing to the volume of data that passes from the user to the server and back.
													</p>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">These websites and applications are built with a variety of platforms and coding 
														techniques, including Wordpress, Drupal, and the MERN stack; or by using server-side technologies, such as PHP.  
														For the more conscientious-minded amongst us, these sites can now be built 'green' as well, using techniques 
														and technologies that reflect advancements in the field of 'green' techonologies in the area of professional 
														web development.

														<h3 class="portfolio-header">Industrial and Commercial Sites</h3>
													</header>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Commercial and industrial websites and applications are a broad group of website 
														that caters to larger, or even global companies.  These websites are for major players in their respective fields, 
														and often require many individual pages and databases to be developed and integrated seamlessly within a dispersed 
														network, all while made suiable for thousands of visitors a day, each looking for different things.  The sheer volume 
														of data that must be processed daily puts these websites in a different category altogether.
													</p>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">The technologies that can be used to build these sites is a bit tighter than for blogs and 
														small businesses, owing to the significantly larger payload that these sites must accurately deliver on a daily basis.  
														Search engine optimization and data capturing and analysis are also quite crucial to these types of businesses, 
														as staying on top gets harder and harder, the higher you climb.

														<h3 class="portfolio-header">Resumés and Curriculum Vitae</h3>
													</header>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">The rule for resumés is two pages maximum, right?  Wrong.  Not with digital.  With 
														a digital resumé from Project Muse, there's no size limit at all.  There're no awesome limits either, as digital 
														resumés completely break the mold, allowing for enhanced colour, individual style, and all types of digital media 
														as well.  Can't describe how awesome a teacher you were at summer camp?  Show them.  Trouble presenting yourself 
														as a proficient public speaker?  Play it for them.  There's no limit to what can be presented anymore!
													</p>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">A resumé website is a type of 'permanent resumé' that's always available online.  It is 
														similar to a curriculum vitae because the intention is to list employment details with much greater accuracy and 
														freedom than would normally be permitted.  The other advantage to having an online resumé or curriculum vitae from 
														Project Muse is that you can significantly reduce the labour involved in job hunting, or for career advancement. 
														Just list your major accomplishments, as best as you can, and then redirect readers to the larger, online version.	
														This saves hours, per resumé, of picking out the correct information, writing it perfectly, and then sending it in, 
														all while your profile says something different anyways, only to have that resumé land in the 'no' pile without 
														any explanation why.

														<h3 class="portfolio-header">Self-Publishing and Other sites</h3>
													</header>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">The Internet offers a simple solution for writers, photographers, academics, journalists, 
														and other professionals, whose careers involve a large degree of writing and sharing media, combined with the 
														potentially difficult prospect of finding publishers and an audience.  You can self-publish.  Wedding ceremonies, 
														End of Life presentations, Prom Night, winning the big game, that time you did stand-up comedy and got the whole 
														room to laugh uncontrollably, by accident, etc.  All of these momentus occassions in life can now be published online, 
														so that family and friends can relive them and share in the stories that made them who they are, as often as they like, 
														and with whomever they choose.
													</p>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">It's called family blogging, and it's on the rise.  Why deal with Tik-Tok and YouTube 
														algorythms if you're not going pro on Tik-Tok or YouTube?  Instead, the next time you host that backyard barbecue, 
														find yourself in-between shots at the charity golf tournament, or just hanging out at the pub after work with friends, 
														don't stress about going through your whole YouTube channel just trying to find that great thing you posted about 
														a few months ago.  Just take out your phone and pull open your family blog.  You'll look like a pro, and have fun 
														reliving the moment.  And that's what it's all about, right?
