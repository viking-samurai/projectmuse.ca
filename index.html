														<h3 class="portfolio-header">Blogs and Small Business Sites</h3>
													</header>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">For entrepreneurs and local businesses in Calgary and the surrounding 
														area aiming to establish a strong online presence, the right website or web application is crucial. 
														Whether you're running a blog to share your expertise with the local community or managing a small 
														business requiring customer interaction within the region, a visually appealing front-end is essential 
														for attracting and engaging local visitors. Often, these platforms benefit from a robust back-end 
														to support features like user profiles, appointment scheduling, and community forums. E-commerce 
														websites serving the Calgary area, in particular, frequently fall into this category, demanding 
														sophisticated back-end systems to handle the flow of transaction data.
													</p>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">As a software developer based in Calgary, I leverage a range of powerful 
														platforms and coding techniques to build these tailored web solutions for businesses like yours. This 
														includes popular content management systems like WordPress and Drupal, as well as modern JavaScript-based 
														stacks such as the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Additionally, I utilize server-side 
														technologies like PHP to create dynamic and efficient websites. For businesses in the Calgary area 
														prioritizing sustainability, I also specialize in developing "green" websites, employing eco-conscious 
														techniques and technologies that minimize environmental impact within the web development process.

														<h3 class="portfolio-header">Industrial and Commercial Sites</h3>
													</header>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">For established commercial and industrial businesses in Calgary and 
														the broader region, a sophisticated online presence is paramount. These websites and applications 
														cater to major players in sectors like manufacturing, energy, and large-scale distribution. Unlike 
														smaller sites, these platforms often require extensive, interconnected networks of individual pages 
														and databases to manage complex operations such as wholesale ordering from warehouses, supply chain 
														management, and detailed product catalogs. Imagine a Calgary-based manufacturer needing a website 
														that allows distributors across Alberta to log in, view real-time inventory, and place bulk orders. 
														These sites must be engineered to handle thousands of daily visitors, each seeking specific information, 
														from product specifications to technical documentation. The sheer volume of data processed daily truly 
														sets these websites apart.
													</p>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Given the critical need for speed, reliability, and security for these high-traffic 
														platforms, the technology stack often leans towards robust and scalable solutions. While various options exist, 
														technologies known for their performance in handling large datasets and complex integrations are frequently 
														employed. This might include powerful database systems, efficient server-side languages, and well-architected 
														APIs to ensure seamless data flow across the network. For these businesses, particularly in competitive 
														industries like oil and gas or advanced manufacturing in Alberta, a strong search engine optimization (SEO) 
														strategy is crucial for maintaining visibility. Furthermore, advanced data capture and analysis tools are 
														essential for gaining insights into customer behavior, optimizing supply chains, and making informed business 
														decisions as they navigate the complexities of a larger market.

														<h3 class="portfolio-header">Resumés and Curriculum Vitae</h3>
													</header>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Forget the outdated two-page resumé rule! In the digital realm, especially 
														with a dynamic resumé website from Project Muse, limitations vanish. Embrace the freedom of unlimited space 
														to showcase your skills, experience, and personality. Go beyond static text with vibrant colors, personalized 
														design, and a rich array of digital media. Want to truly illustrate your impact as a summer camp teacher? 
														Embed a video testimonial from a camper! Struggling to convey your public speaking prowess? Include 
														a short clip of you in action. With a digital resumé, the possibilities for impactful self-presentation 
														are truly limitless.
													</p>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Think of a resumé website as your always-on, comprehensive professional portfolio. 
														Functioning similarly to a curriculum vitae, it allows for a level of detail and accuracy in presenting your 
														career history that traditional paper résumés simply can't match. One of the most significant advantages of 
														having an online resumé or CV crafted by Project Muse is the dramatic reduction in time and effort spent 
														on job hunting or pursuing career advancement. Simply highlight your key achievements on a concise introductory 
														document, your LinkedIn profile, or even on tailored résumés you upload to platforms like Indeed.com, and then
														direct interested parties to your detailed online showcase. This eliminates the repetitive and time-consuming 
														process of constantly tweaking résumés for each application, ensures consistent messaging across all your 
														job-seeking activities, and provides employers with a richer, more dynamic understanding of your qualifications 
														beyond the confines of a static document.

														<h3 class="portfolio-header">Self-Publishing and Other sites</h3>
													</header>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">The Internet offers a simple solution for writers, photographers, academics, journalists, 
														and other professionals, whose careers involve a large degree of writing and sharing media, combined with the 
														potentially difficult prospect of finding publishers and an audience.  You can self-publish.  Wedding ceremonies, 
														End of Life presentations, Prom Night, winning the big game, that time you did stand-up comedy and got the whole 
														room to laugh uncontrollably, by accident, etc.  All of these momentus occassions in life can now be published online, 
														so that family and friends can relive them and share in the stories that made them who they are, as often as they like, 
														and with whomever they choose.
													</p>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">It's called family blogging, and it's on the rise.  Why deal with Tik-Tok and YouTube 
														algorythms if you're not going pro on Tik-Tok or YouTube?  Instead, the next time you host that backyard barbecue, 
														find yourself in-between shots at the charity golf tournament, or just hanging out at the pub after work with friends, 
														don't stress about going through your whole YouTube channel just trying to find that great thing you posted about 
														a few months ago.  Just take out your phone and pull open your family blog.  You'll look like a pro, and have fun 
														reliving the moment.  And that's what it's all about, right?
