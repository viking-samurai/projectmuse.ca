													</header>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">For Calgary entrepreneurs and local businesses aiming for a strong online presence, 
														choosing the right foundation for your website or application is key. While various platforms exist, such 
														as Drupal or Wordpress, modern full-stack solutions, like blending PHP and the MERN stack, are increasingly 
														recognized for their superior performance, scalability, and efficiency.  This blend often leads to more 
														environmentally conscious websites as well, which works to everyone's advantage.  So, whether you're building 
														a community blog, or a local e-commerce platform, with robust features like user accounts and scheduled 
														deliveries, the underlying technology you choose for your website or application significantly impacts your 
														project's long-term success.
													</p>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">As a Calgary-based software developer, I focus on building scalable web solutions 
														using powerful and efficient technologies like PHP and the MERN stack. These tools allow for a tailored 
														web development experience, ensuring that your website or application not only looks great, but also performs 
														optimally and scales seamlessly as your business grows. Let's explore how leveraging a modern, efficient 
														technology stack can provide your Calgary business with a competitive edge and a sustainable, online presence.

													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">Established Calgary industrial and commercial powerhouses, including leaders 
														in manufacturing and the oil and gas sector, face the critical need for a sophisticated online presence

														ordering and supply chains, to comprehensive product catalogs with real-time volume tracking. Project 
														Muse specializes in architecting and building these high-performance platforms, ensuring seamless data 
														flow and the capacity to manage thousands of daily interactions and vast data volumes.

														energy and manufacturing, along with advanced data capturing and analysis tools to provide invaluable 
														insights for optimizing your operations, and gaining a significant competitive edge.

													</header>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">The Internet offers a simple solution for writers, photographers, academics, 
														journalists, and other professionals who write and share media, bypassing the traditional hurdle of having 
														to find a publisher or producer. You can self-publish! Imagine, your garage band's entire itinerary online, 
														or some of life's momentous occasions, all tacfully displayed and right at your fingertips – weddings, 
														presentations, prom night, those big games, even those accidental triumphs, caught on film – so family 
														and friends can relive and share these stories as often as they like, with whomever they choose.
													</p>
													<p class="portfolio-paragraph">It's called family blogging, and it's on the rise. Why deal with complex social 
														media algorithms to find your own resources if you're not aiming to go professional with social media? 
														Instead, at your next gathering or casual hangout, easily access your family blog to share and relive great 
														moments, without the stress of searching through endless feeds. It's a user-friendly way to connect with loved 
														ones and enjoy shared memories together.
