									<h2 style="color: #12a8f2;">Starting from Scratch</h2>
									<p>The three part web development process</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									At ProjectMuse.ca, I've learned that the best way to build a website from scratch is by following a
									simple, three-step process to take a customer from an idea to a finished project.  This revelation came
									about because modern websites are deceptively large projects that require significant planning, as well
									as intense scrutiny all along the way.  The three step process	is designed to engage with the customer 
									in a number	of ways to help bring ideas about and discuss their viability, without backtracking and redoing
									steps.  The three step process looks like this:  <u><strong>Step 1</strong></u>: Designing your website.  
									<u><strong>Step 2</strong></u>: Building your website.  <u><strong>Step 3</strong></u>: Filling your website.  
									Following this process allows us to work together in smaller sections at a time, while always maintaining 
									the larger picture of what we're building.
								</p>
								<p>
									To develop a website with me, you will require the following: <b>1: </b>A business plan. 
									<b>2: </b>Access to a chatroom application, such as Discord or Slack. <b>3: </b>An active domain.  <b>4: </b>
									At least three months time before any hard deadlines.  It is possible to avoid some steps, particularly
									in scenarios where a design	has already been issued, or if there is	already some type of framework in place, 
									but as a general rule, it's	a three step process, and I intend to follow all three steps.
								</p>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Step 1: <span style="color: #12a8f2;">Designing your Website</span></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										A proper design for your new website is an essential component for its overall success.  Are you 
										looking	for a single page application (SPA), or a multi-page application (MPA)?   Will it require
										a backend, or just a contact page?  Are you hoping to draw insight from data, or does your project
										revolve around extracting data?  Do you like the colour blue, and does it fit your overall theme?
										These are all questions	that come up in the design process, and it's important that we have a solid
										understanding of both your preferences and your goals before we begin.  Note, at this stage, I advise
										all clients to focus on the	design more than the auxillaries, such as logos and marketing slogans.
										I have a team of professionals to help with that once we get going, but it's always better to work
										from more information than less information.
									</p>
									<p>
										At this stage, it is essential that you have at least a simple business plan and access to a chatroom
										service, such as Discord or Slack.  Purchasing a domain and the three month timeframe are more essential
										once the build process actually starts.  It takes a while to fully envision what ypu want to accomplish
										with your website.  I'll need to understand both your business objectives as well as get a feel for your
										design preferences before we dive in.
									</p>

									<header>
										<h3>Step 2: <span style="color: #12a8f2;">Building your Website</span></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										The second stage of the web constuction process is to frame and build your website on a live, non-public
										server.  I prefer to use Github for the framing and building of a website, because I find it's the easiest
										way to access a site on the Internet without significant exposure for either the customer or myself.  All
										you need for me to start this process is access to a laptop and a cellphone, as those are the two main types
										of media from which most public websites are generally accessed.  As I'm working, I send you live updates of
										your project to ensure that your design is mapping into reality the way that you intend it to. 
									</p>
									<p>
										At this stage we also start to develop some of the content that will go into the website, particularly your
										company logo, company imagery, and any major branding or marketing slogans that you intend to see adopted.
										During this process, most of the written content of the site will be filled out using filler text in latin,
										and most of the graphics and imagery will be stock photos and images, specifically intended to take up space,
										so that we get a feel for the layout and appearence of the site before diving into the content properly.  If
										you happen to have some content or photos already, let me know; but for the most part, these are not necessary
										until the final step, and staying too focused on earlier versions of your intentions can lead to flaws in the
										completion of your project by trying to fit earlier ideas and later concepts together.  I also strongly advise
										against outsourcing content and graphics on your own, as this can lead to cost run-ups as other companies hold
										your work hostage to try and claim a bigger piece of the pie.  I've seen it happen.
									</p>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Step 3: <span style="color: #12a8f2;">Filling your Website</span></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										The third step to building your website is to fill it in with appropriate content and graphics.  For this,
										I have preferred graphics designers and artists that I outsource to, depending on particular style of your
										website.  Anim√© specialists, text and graffiti artists, biker themes, heavy country, light country... You
										name it.  The reason why I do this is to pair the right artist to the right website and just let them go.
										When it comes to graphics and artwork, I'm good, but I'm not great; and I'm not afraid to admit that.  In
										a city like Calgary, there's a specialist for what you want at a competitive price, and it's my job to find
										that person and link them up to create a great website.  Trust the process for a great result.
									</p>
									<p>
										What I do handle myself at this stage is all of the writing and search engine optimization.  I've been a writer
										since University, and webwork is my preferred medium for this talent.  I can take on any style, with any voice,
										and produce fantastic results.  I also log what I do, and I begin to develop your own, personal SEO portfolio
										at this junction, which we'll use down the road to keep your website as high on Google search results as possible
										in the years to come.
