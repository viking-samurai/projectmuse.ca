										<h4>A look at how challenging the entrepreneur's path can actually be.</h4><br />
										<p class="blog-paragraph">
											I once watched a podcast by Dr. Jordan Peterson on YouTube.  I honestly couldn’t tell you which one anymore, as it’s 
											been too long since I saw it; but in it, he makes mention to the idea that you wouldn’t necessarily want Moses, the 
											biblical persona, hanging out in the Garden of Eden.  This makes sense.  It’s not that he wouldn’t be allowed, and 
											certainly not to poke holes into any biblical references; but simply: Moses had to have been a very hard man.  This 
											is a guy who stood up to a Pharaoh on multiple occasions, and who oversaw crossing the desert for 40 years to help 
											save the Isrealites.  Even if he did make it all the way to Eden, do you really think he’d find his inner-peace there?  
											I don’t.
										</p>
										<p class="blog-paragraph">
											The story of the Exodus in the Bible is a direct reference to leadership, constitution, forbearance, and a dozen other 
											high-virtues, exemplified by one absolute renegade named Moses.  It also fits the framework of the ‘Hero’s Journey’, 
											a type of storytelling template that involves a hero who goes on a quest, is victorious in a decisive encounter, and 
											then returns home from the quest with new knowledge to share.  I find entrepreneurship follows similar 
											patterns as well, and this is what I wanted to try and explain.  Not to make light, but it isn’t too hard to see the 
											parallels even between Moses’s journey, and what everyday entrepreneurs actually go through.  Moses sided with the 
											Isrealites, and then ended up going to great lengths to free them from persecution, the same as an entrepreneur sees 
											a need for social change in their own environment, and then goes to great lengths to bring it about.  Make no mistake, 
											what an entrepreneur does for a living is fraught with peril, and potentially quite dangerous, either economically 
											(monetarily), or, in other senses, it could be literally dangerous, too.  But to the entrepreneur there is always a 
											need, or else they wouldn’t have taken up the cause in the first place.
										</p>
										<p class="blog-paragraph">
											Before continuing, I have to pause to admit something here: I’m not a religious person, and this is not an article 
											about Moses, per se.  But I like the story of The Exodus for explaining entrepreneurship, because I find that there 
											are a number of parallels between the idea of parting waters, crossing a desert, and then proclaiming a new way from 
											atop a mountain, and what the process of developing a new business actually looks like.  In fact, I would even suggest 
											that parting the waters, crossing a desert, and then climbing a mountain are, in a metaphorical sense, the three main 
											stints of an entrepreneurial journey in and of itself.  Let me explain.
										</p>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>Parting the Waters</h3>
											</header>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												If you’re familiar with the story of The Exodus, then you’re aware that Moses ‘parted the sea’, allowing his people 
												to cross, and then, once his people had crossed, he let the sea come crashing down on the Pharaoh’s army.  In this 
												sense, the sea serves as a metaphor for a barrier, with something trapped away on the other side.  It takes conviction 
												to see through that barrier, which can come in a number of different forms.  For Moses, conviction was represented by 
												an act of God, to create a path.  An entrepreneur today may not need to go to such extremes, but the metaphor still 
												stands.  Like a dog pacing behind a fence, an entrepreneur knows that there are two choices: to stay, or to commit.  
												Once committed, it can be very difficult to disengage.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												The water, as a type of barrier, can be representative of any number of different situations, and is almost never 
												a fixed point.  Rather, it is the ‘rock and the hard place’ metaphor, where surviving death is suddenly a superior 
												option to whatever is the current norm.  It serves as a type of gate in the sense that it must be crossed, yet it 
												is not immediately apparent how to cross it.  For most people, crossing the water is simply the knowledge that if 
												you succeed at your entrepreneurial endeavour, then life will be better.  We could get into more serial entrepreneurs 
												as well, and the calculations factored into making this decision as a way of life, but it’s the same fundamental 
												principle for them as well.  What’s crucial to realize is that this is the first fork in the journey, and that 
												choosing to go forward at this juncture makes it much harder to turn back.  At this point, as an entrepreneur, 
												you’re either committed to the idea that whatever’s on the other side of the gate is better than whatever you 
												currently have, or else you shouldn’t try to cross the gate, as you may not be able to turn back.
											</p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>Crossing the Desert</h3>
											</header>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												The fundamental idea of crossing a desert is the idea of being forced to adapt.  Whether this is learning something 
												new, or simply coming into an aggressive market; the point is to recognize that you have entered into a very harsh 
												climate, one that you may or may not be native to, and you’ll just have to deal with it.  I want to point out here 
												as well that Moses might well have known that there was a desert beyond the sea, and how hard it would actually be 
												to survive.  I bring this up because you should be aware of your own deserts, too.  Unless you’re a serial 
												entrepreneur, or else actively working in the field that you’re moving into, then chances are, you’ll not only have 
												to part the water, but that you’ll also have to learn how to survive on the other side as well.  This caveat should 
												not be taken for granted.  This can be extremely challenging, as you’ve just left behind everything you know on the 
												promise of something better, and now you just have to figure it out, likely with less than what you started with.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												To me, the most challenging part of surviving the desert is the need to consume, especially when you may not even 
												be aware of either what to consume, nor how to consume it.  I think one of the most simple traps here is that you 
												had the idea, and you parted the waters just fine, and now that the gate lies open, it’s like it’s so open that 
												you don’t even know what to do about it.  Imagine looking back at the Pharaoh’s army, defeated, and then looking 
												ahead at so much sand and horizon that it was nothing short of disorienting.  You won,  but now, what did you win?  
												The key at this stage is simply learning to survive.  I remember while I was going to school, a friend of mine 
												asked the rhetorical question of how do you eat an elephant?  The answer is one bite at a time, and that’s how 
												you survive a desert, too.  You take it one day at a time, until you learn to build.  Once you start to build, you 
												can start to store, and then you’re learning to cope.
											</p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>Climbing the Mountain</h3>
											</header>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												Finally, this idea of learning to build is what brings us to the metaphor of the mountain.  In The Exodus, the mountain 
												serves as a type of structure, and it is highly symbolic, both for the latent symbolism of proclaiming something from 
												‘on high’, but also, because the mountain itself serves as the structural representation of the will of the people.  
												In essence, reading the ten commandments from the top of Mount Sinai is symbolic of the idea of infinity, particularly 
												in the sense of being able to replicate the journey which brought forth the ten commandments in the first place.  The 
												point of reading the commandments isn’t to admonish his followers, or ‘let them know who’s boss’, but simply, to 
												disperse the information contained within.  This is effectively the same as what an entrepreneur does once the business 
												is built, and they are looking for clients.  They establish their presence.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												While still very challenging, I have Moses climbing the mountain as the least challenging of his three main trials, 
												and I think that this representation would also stand in terms of business development as well.  Once a business reaches 
												the mountain stage, everything should be working, in some sense or another.  If the mountain stage represents replication 
												towards infinity, then it can be seen as a type of blueprint for success.  Similarly, when a business reaches the 
												mountain stage, it begins to proclaim itself, developing its identity and its presence through how and to whom it gets 
												marketed, in essence.
											</p>

												<h3>Endurance and Renewal</h3>
											</header>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												A key takeaway of The Exodus story is in considering where the locus of control is situated with each new iteration of 
												hardship, and then learning how this is relevant to what you’re trying to accomplish as an entrepreneur.  Consider this 
												take, for example:  The first trial that Moses has to pass is crossing the waters, but in order to do so, he must suspend 
												his own doubt at the undertaking, and learn to believe in something greater than what he would normally be capable of 
												accomplishing.  This is that flash of inspiration, when an entrepreneur first locks onto something.  What’s relevant at 
												this juncture is that the idea isn’t actually all there yet, and that faith must be placed into something that the 
												entrepreneur cannot, on their own, control.  In a sense, all they can do is prepare for the jump, and when they see the 
												window, decide whether or not to take it.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												Next up is the desert, and the part where the entrepreneur finally starts to develop agency over what they’re accomplishing.  
												Make no mistake, God didn’t help Moses wander the desert for 40 years.  It would have been both a waste of time, and counter 
												to His point in the first place.  So no, short of a little inspiration here and there, crossing that desert was all Moses; 
												learning to survive, and learning to guide.  The desert is an important motif in understanding the entrepreneur’s journey 
												as well.  Never forget: just because you had a great idea, it doesn’t mean that you’re actually any good at your idea.  
												Those are two separate domains, and the difference between seeing a great need for change, and then understanding, perhaps, 
												why that change hasn’t happened yet can make or break the success of the business.  You will likely need to become the 
												change you wish to see, and that’s all part of the process.  The desert is the part where the locus of control shifts away 
												from the divine, and onto the person themselves.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												Finally, we come to the mountain, from which Moses proclaims his ten commandments, and where we see the locus of control 
												shift away from both inspiration or an individual, and onto the crowd itself.  It’s at this point that the entrepreneur 
												starts easing up.  The structure is now built, and it’s time to sell it.  By shifting the locus away from themselves, 
												the entrepreneur concedes that from this point onward, the business will only function through reciprocity and exchange.  
												This is why this part is dedicated to branding, marketing, and developing a client base. It's relationships that matter 
												the most at this important step, and the fundamental relationship being established is that the entrepreneur has something 
												that the rest of the population would benefit greatly from.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												Fundamentally, the relevance of the ten commandments is their usefulness in constructing a society.  In essence, it’s the 
												same with your business.  At first, you just catch a glimpse of an idea, and you hold onto it.  That idea will grow, one 
												way or another, and as you start to learn more about your idea, through research, networking, and your own feel for the 
												market, that idea will either become viable or not.  Don’t be afraid to let it go if it isn’t viable, as you don’t want 
												to gamble on things you don’t trust from the start.  But if the idea does start to become viable, then look for an opening, 
												and try to get yourself through the door.  Once you’re through the door, you’ll likely find that the idea you had is 
												actually much more complicated than what you initially thought.  This is the act of surviving the desert, or becoming 
												what you will become.  Through repeated hardship at learning how to develop your idea, you become your own master, and 
												that’s when you’re ready to start proclaiming, and developing a society around your idea.  As this society grows and 
												develops around you, people who know what you do will eventually require your services, and those are the people who will
												 become your product’s consumers.  It takes persistence throughout the entire journey to get your business to this state, 
												 and you should be proud of your accomplishment.
