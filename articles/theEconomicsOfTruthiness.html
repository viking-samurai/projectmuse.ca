										<h4>Examining the reality that an entreprenur should never be afraid to ask for what they're worth.</h4><br />
										<p class="blog-paragraph">When you study economics for the first time, two of the first few 
											things you’ll learn are that trading should benefit everyone involved, and that very few 
											commodities in this Universe have any intrinsic value whatsoever.  These two rules stick 
											out as primary, or core rules in economics, commerce, and trade, because they are foundational 
											to the very concept of ‘the flow of goods and services’ itself.  In fact, understanding 
											these two principles, particularly in relationship to each other, is even more important 
											than getting a feel for supply, demand, and equilibrium positions, because without understanding 
											how correlations between investment and cost actually determine values, you’d be hard pressed 
											to understand how these values fluctuate through the principles of supply and demand in the 
											first place.
										</p>
										<p class="blog-paragraph">With that, let’s start with the first principle listed, that 
											trade should benefit everyone involved.  In my opinion, it is of paramount importance 
											to understand that all trade, everywhere, should always benefit everyone involved to 
											some degree, because without understanding this concept, it becomes rather difficult 
											to understand how pressure builds within an open system to force equilibriums throughout 
											the market.  The fact that any consumer, for any reason, can simply choose to abort 
											one trade directive for another, regardless of purpose or pride, forces everyone at 
											the table to always be considerate of everyone else at the table, as well as 
											themselves.  Remember in an earlier article that I wrote, I mentioned that nothing 
											is ever worth anything until it actually gets sold?  This is why.  In a market driven 
											scenario, where there are always innumerable choices that every consumer can make 
											in order to fulfill their consumption needs, any player who makes a habit of ‘bucking’ 
											the equilibrium is likely to be ignored by the other players in the game at some point.  
											This works from virtually every direction: from having prices too high, to not charging 
											enough in the first place, to just being a generally rough player, consistently avoiding 
											signs that you are not reaching a state of equilibrium against your overt purpose, 
											within a given trade environment, is likely to cause your removal from that trade 
											environment in one of several fashions.
										</p>
										<p class="blog-paragraph">Next up, the idea that virtually no commodity, anywhere in the 
											Universe, has any intrinsic value, whatsoever.  This one is both technically challenging 
											to rationalize, but also crucial in understanding how that old ‘invisible hand’ 
											of the market even works.  The philosophy conveyed through the idea that no commodity 
											has any sort of intrinsic value is that of unlimited agency.  Because the ‘real’ value 
											of any given object (thought, product, or service) is actually zero, the only way to 
											obtain a value for that object is by deriving it.  This is fundamentally the starting 
											point as well as the overt purpose of the aforementioned ‘market’.  It’s not so much 
											a real place, though that often matters, as it is a list of perceived forces, real 
											or otherwise, that are, or are being used as, determinant factors in assessing the 
											value of a given commodity.  All sorts or cards get played at this point, and one can 
											envision the floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange just as readily as a lemonade stand 
											on a hot day in your local Calgary suburb, and more or less arrive at many of the 
											same conclusions about both.  Regardless of your particular imagination, these 
											determining factors are what eventually gets simplified into the concepts of supply 
											and demand, long after the need to trade in order to progress is formally recognized 
											in the first place.  What follows is a look at some basic concepts in economics 
											(don’t kid yourself here, none of this is basic), as well as how these concepts interact 
											with each other in the development and maintenance of a ‘market’.  My hope is that 
											people learn to value their own labour more, and maybe even walk away with some 
											practical advice on how to deploy it industriously, towards a long and profitable 
											career.  Enjoy!

												<h3>Paying for the Opportunity</h3>
											</header>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">In a rudimentary sense, the way that an economy actually works 
												is that each participant within that economy has both a set of needs, and then a set 
												of advantages and disadvantages by which to achieve those needs.  Generally speaking, 
												the needs of a society converge, and lead to the development of markets through demand, 
												while the relative advantages and disadvantages of societies diverge, and lead to the 
												development of industry to produce supply.  The divergent aspects of societies leads 
												to specialization, where competition along the same frontiers takes a toll which 
												is reflected by the prices of a given commodity within a market, while competition 
												along divergent frontiers leads to more products for a given market (which can also 
												affect prices).  When you purchase a good or a service from a market, you are 
												exchanging your labour for the perceived labour of developing the good or service 
												which you are purchasing.  Most often, this exchange takes place by one party expending 
												money to acquire the object they desire.  It also takes place through several other 
												methods, however, with direct trade being the other method which most immediately 
												comes to mind.  The primary reason why markets benefit society is because of an 
												economics trigger commonly referred to as ‘opportunity cost’.  The idea behind 
												‘opportunity cost' is that specialized goods cannot actually be produced by an 
												individual at anywhere near the quality or price that a specialist could produce 
												that good or service for.  When you’re buying something, whether it’s a toy around 
												the holidays, or two hours of an accountant’s time, what you’re actually paying 
												for is vastly more complex to arrive at than what you could accomplish on your own 
												at that point in time, and also significantly less than what it would cost you 
												to do so.  This happens because of industry competition in the background, and 
												the term ‘opportunity cost’ is derived from the idea that you are paying for the 
												opportunity to leverage the existing market equilibrium to your advantage for the 
												purpose of progressing your unique set of needs forward.  This happens across the 
												economy, both for every individual person, as well as each business and corporation 
												actively participating in the market, all the time.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">So, while I laud the DIYer, and believe me, I went and learned JavaScript 
												on my own, so I have a lot of respect for people going the extra mile to better themselves 
												and trying to spend less doing it, I wanted to point out that if you did this for each and 
												every activity of your life, you wouldn’t really have too much time left over for yourself.  
												At some point, you will run into some things that you really are better off paying for 
												the opportunity to have or to acquire at a professional capacity, than to do it on your own.  
												And this is a very good thing.  It creates a demand which is then brought to a market and 
												supplied, suitably, according to the means of the individual carrying the demand, against 
												the supply of the commodity by the industry to which that commodity is generally beholden.  
												When this exchange happens, satisfaction on the side of the demand reinforces the drive 
												to continue to supply that demand by means of the currency traded in its acquisition.  
												This currency is used by the shopkeep to restock, paying a supplier to reacquire, and 
												on and on, back to the hands of the very labourers who make the product, and then send 
												it on its journey in the first place.  At this point, I’ll drop a quick line to point 
												out that my purpose is not to dwell on the plights or issues of anyone involved in any 
												particular supply chain, or demand consortium, but merely to explain, in brief, how these 
												forces actually interact in tandem to drive an economy.  Essentially, what each side is 
												trying to do is to maintain equilibrium across an imaginary frontier, which is likely 
												the most efficient in servicing demand, while simultaneously, likely, the most profitable 
												towards developing supply.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">What gets interesting about these forces is that, the more frequently 
												this interaction takes place for a given commodity, the better each side becomes at 
												maintaining equilibrium.  This is where competition within a market, represented by 
												the choice of the consumer on the demand side, meeting with the capacity of the industry 
												on the supply side, drives the price for a given commodity.  This is also why the idea 
												of ‘shopping local’ is very important to the overall health of a specific economy.  
												When you ‘shop local’, the currency exchanged in the satisfaction of demand reinforces 
												industry specialization at a local level, leading to more varied (because industry 
												competition pushes agents along divergent paths) and higher quality (because market 
												competition forces suppliers to add value in some form or another to beat out rivals) 
												products.  When this happens locally, everyone locally involved benefits.  Prices stay 
												stable and quality stays high, with market equilibrium tending to last longer, because 
												everyone is content with the status quo.  When this does not happen locally, local issues 
												can spring up, particularly during times of industry extremes.  Note the application 
												of what is called ‘Dutch economics’ here.  You can look it up for a more accurate definition, 
												but the gist of it is that resource rich environments which do not trade often tend to 
												fare poorer than non-resource rich environments which frequently trade.  The point is, 
												it is the act of competitive trading which produces specializations at the local level 
												that strengthens a given economy, not the apparent resources of that particular region.  
												When you spend your labour locally, your labour stays local, longer, and this helps 
												an area flourish by keeping local talent engaged in activities which benefit their 
												immediate community.  You might literally be paying for the opportunity for everyone 
												in your immediate area to get better, but when viewed as a type of community investment, 
												that’s actually a far superior option than reinforcing talent elsewhere.

												<h3>Why the World is Better 'Flush'</h3>
											</header>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">Remember the CERB cheques during the pandemic?  The idea was simple, 
												and generally would be the correct path for a nation to pursue, following the outbreak of 
												such a force of nature.  As businesses were shutting down to accommodate public health concerns, 
												there was fear of a ripple effect spreading throughout the economy, this ripple being the 
												ability of the market to reinforce industry through currency, and thus shutting down the 
												supply side of the Canadian economy for lack of enough monetary incentive to effectively 
												reinforce the industries supplying it.  The government of Canada, as many others around the 
												world, made the decision to keep its population ‘flush’, so as to keep its economic machine 
												powered throughout what it believed would be the duration of the ordeal.  Now, one can debate 
												any number of facets about how this all rolled out, but to the extent that it was the superior 
												choice to make, at the point when federal and provincial public health orders went out, assuming 
												that our government didn’t predict a rise in mortgages fueled by temporary cash (which is not 
												unreasonable, however incorrect this assumption proved to be), there should be very little doubt 
												that it was the right call to make.  Now, why do I bring up CERB cheques during the pandemic 
												to illustrate my point about the world being better off flush?  As we saw with the continued 
												rise in housing prices throughout the pandemic, when people have money, they tend to spend it.  
												Generally, this is a good thing from an economics point of view.  It’s what you want to see 
												in a healthy, participatory economy.  The inflationary period that Canada experienced during 
												the aftermath of the pandemic, as well as the nature of the crisis in the housing market dubbed 
												‘the Canadian Housing Bubble’ (I avoid this pretty name where I can) actually have more to 
												do with existing economic conditions in Canada, rather than the CERB cheques themselves.  
												They were just a catalyst.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">Now, metaphorically, money acts as a type of oil to keep the economy flowing, 
												keeping in mind that the economy is actually the exchange of labour in the form of money, and not 
												the exchange of money for its own sake (this is where proponents of the ‘Universal Basic Income’ 
												theory fall short in the debate.  It’s labour that drives an economy, not money).  Following this, 
												virtually all the popular economic issues that you hear about (and this generalization is for 
												expediency, not simplicity) have to do in some way with the intentional or unintentional constriction 
												of the flow of money or labour towards a desired or undesired equilibrium.  At this point, 
												I’m going to move away from Canadian examples so as to stay focused on the effect of money 
												on the economy itself, as that is my intended direction here.  Every country has a unique set 
												of economic controls for its own reasons, but we're here to understand why a richer population 
												is more useful to a nation than a poorer one.  The reason for this is largely because wealth 
												and capital remove constraints to investment at an individual level, which increases the frequency 
												of market exchanges, which, as we looked at earlier, makes everyone more efficient in how they 
												are serving their local communities.  When you consistently shop local, and you pay appropriate 
												prices for the goods and services you purchase relative to your community standards, it reinforces 
												local talent.  This is where the concept of ‘honest work for honest pay’ takes hold and truly 
												shines.  When local talent succeeds, if they are not paid sufficiently to cover their labour 
												and reinvest in themselves through market participation outside of their actual jobs, it does 
												a disservice to the community as a whole by trimming the ability of local participants to engage 
												with their local economic community for their wants and needs.  Over time, this results in 
												stunted industries through lowered economic activity, and is not good for the health of a given 
												population.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">On the other hand, when the people of a given community are flush, that 
												community will tend to flourish.  The reason for this is because, outside of their basic needs, 
												the people of the community are able to start reinvesting in their community for the sake of 
												improving their experience of it.  Generally speaking, investment does not devalue existing 
												commodities, except in rare situations where investment causes an entire population to abruptly 
												shift its habits over a relatively short period, and then that population stays in the new habit 
												without reprisal going forward.  This is generally how the world progresses in large steps, 
												and these situations tend to be fairly marked and well documented.  Now, there are obviously 
												a plethora of situations where the wrong type of investment can make something worse, but, 
												generally speaking, investment is good for a community, and not investing is bad for it.  
												Furthering that logic, wealthier communities have more to invest in themselves, and therefore, 
												tend to stay wealthier.  Poorer communities do not, and so on and so forth...  Where people 
												tend to err here is in the assumption that only governments, charities, and large corporations 
												invest in communities.  This isn’t true.  Every person or business that commits to transacting 
												within their local environment is actively contributing to both the markets within that environment, 
												as well as the industries which support those markets.  Every idea you have that you develop 
												to some degree, whether it’s taking on a coaching role for your daughter’s hockey team, or 
												just that iconic tree-fort in the backyard for fantasy stories with the dragon lover in your 
												house.  If it involved your labour, it was an investment in your community.  And it mattered.

												<h3>Honestly, it's Worth It...</h3>
											</header>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">There’s a running joke in JavaScript, the programming language that I write in.  
												When writing conditionals, there are three concepts which each fall under the umbrella of ‘equals’, 
												and they are expressed with either one, two, or three equals signs.  The joke is that, while the first 
												and the third (one and three equals signs) are relatively easy to understand and deploy properly, the 
												second one, which evaluates a concept called ‘truthiness’, tends to be quite a bit trickier to grasp.  
												The reason for this is because the term truthiness covers a range of abstract concepts in math and 
												programming that can all start to wash together as your scripts get longer, while the first and third 
												are simply declarative and ‘for exact representations’, in that order.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">I wanted to pull this concept out of my day job and evaluate it more broadly, 
												because I think it’s important that as a society, we start to understand what all goes into 
												solopreneurship, or even just operating a business at large.  The truth is, while every labourer 
												adds value to an economy, not every labourer takes on either the load or the risk that an entrepreneur 
												does, and while it is ultimately the entrepreneur’s choice to persist in their endeavour, there 
												is an inherent truthiness to the idea that these people really do have a heavier workload, as 
												well as a higher burden of responsibility to bear, at least relative to their continued employment.  
												Yes, Capitalism enables an individual to exert control over the assets they develop for themselves, 
												and yes, this can make some people fabulously wealthy, but it’s also important to understand 
												that the world we live in is dynamic, and constantly fluctuating.  There are forces which entrepreneurs 
												must contend with that a great deal of ordinary labourers will simply never encounter throughout 
												their entire careers.  This is why, to me, Capitalism works best when viewed through the lens 
												of truthiness.  Truthiness, as a concept, allows a group of individuals to make evaluations 
												based on systemic inference, rather than declarative assertions.  This means that, in an open 
												system, where each individual is imbued with unlimited agency, truthiness acts as a type of 
												guarantee for overall quality.  And, furthermore, I posit that the more people who are engaged 
												in trade with each other within an open system that are able to employ truthiness to correctly 
												infer from each other, without overt explanation, the healthier that system is, overall.  
												This is because trust exists within that system, and it exists because the people within that 
												system, even if they don’t trust each other personally, tend to be able to trust each other 
												professionally, in order to maintain the system.
											</p>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">I bring this up because I find that many entrepreneurs often sell their 
												accomplishments short, particularly at the outset of a new venture.  I used to do this as well, 
												and I have some experience with straightening this issue out, but it’s not a pleasant problem to 
												have to go back and solve.  It’s also a potentially fatal flaw to an otherwise excellent idea if 
												you don’t get it right, so, always start by selling high, and letting the market work you down to 
												its equilibrium.  The truth is, in almost all scenarios concerning your business, you will know 
												your own strengths and vulnerabilities better than everyone else around you.  Your job, once your 
												business is up, is to maintain your status or priority within the system you belong to, and you 
												will find this feat easiest to accomplish by charging an amount for your labour that never makes 
												you consider leaving one client unsatisfied to pursue another client, just for more money.  This 
												type of planning is disastrous to relationships, and seriously hampers your ability to plan for 
												the long haul with your new venture.  It’s easiest to be truthy upfront, and to make sure that 
												your clients know that you won’t leave them caught in a state of disequilibrium on their projects 
												because you didn’t plan your time or your business for your own success.  Perhaps I’m being 
												optimistic, but you should actively engage with the people you are working with to help them 
												understand what they’re paying for by engaging with a professional, or what your time will 
												eventually yield.  The truth is, if everybody races to the bottom, nobody wins.  Think about 
												it.  You don’t want to work for drastically less than what you’re worth just to get contracts 
												done, and you also wouldn’t buy the work from someone who’s working at their bottom line, just 
												to get the contracts done.  Now take that to the next step.  If all you charge, or all you pay 
												someone is the exact cost of getting a project done, and nothing more for re-investment, of what 
												benefit is that to the larger economy?  No one is getting further by just making ends meet, and 
												while an entrepreneur might be early enough in this process to still be turning out quality 
												products, everyone burns out eventually, and at some point, you burning out will be a detriment 
												to the larger community.  And thus, we arrive at the economics of truthiness.  It turns out that 
												when everyone is honestly selling high, well, everyone just wins.  Cheers!
